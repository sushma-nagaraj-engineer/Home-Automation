# Home-Automation

Microprocessor Final Project Summary:
Context: Raspberry Pi Embedded System that uses C or C++ in the Eclipse Environment
Project Topic: Mini Smart Home
Name: Sushma Sunkollu Nagaraj
Summary:
“Home Automation” is something that is trending today. In this project an attempt will be made to design certain modules of a smart home. The two modules that I have in mind for now are:
a)	Temperature Controlled Fan (motor) using Raspberry Pi and BMP 18 sensor to record temperature, pressure and control the speed of the fan to manage heat. For each measurement cycle the sensor gathers the data and the data gathered is converted to a format that could be used and the same will be transmitted to the Raspberry Pi. The code will then analyses the input data and then controls the fan(motor) accordingly.
b)	Integration of Motion Sensor like a PIR Sensor with Raspberry Pi which turns on an LED/triggering the buzzer when motion is detected. 

 

Complexity Involved:
Understanding how to convert the input data from sensor and send it to Raspberry for processing (like implementing ADC)
Usage of concept of timer and interrupt for the sensors.
